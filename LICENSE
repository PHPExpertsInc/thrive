The Thrive Framework is licensed under two licenses. It is NOT dual licensed in
the traditional sense that one may pick and choose which license they wish to 
abide by: 

    YOU MUST ABIDE BY BOTH LICENSES SIMULTANEOUSLY.

The licenses are
* The Creative Commons Attribution License v3.0 (CC-BY_A)
  This license gives the rights to copy, modify and distribute this source
  code for your own projects, and to compile it into your projects. It does
  not require you to open source your own code (as a copyleft license would).

  All that is required is for you to provide proper attribution that your
  project includes code from the Thrive Framework and links to the URL
  http://www.phpexperts.pro/thrive.

* The Open Source Software Alliance License v1.0 (OSSAL)
  This license *must* be included with any distribution of the source code.
  It prohibits the mixing of this package's code with a copyleft project,
  such as those licensed under the GPL, LGPL, or Creative Commons ShareAlike
  licenses.
